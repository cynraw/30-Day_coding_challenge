  # Typedef for structures
  - Typedef keyword is used to define an alias for the already existing datatype.
  - In structures, we have to use the struct keyword along with the structure name to define the variables.
  - Sometimes, this increases the length and complexity of the code.
  - We can use the typedef to define some new shorter name for the structure.
  - This helps in enhancing code readability by allowing the use of a more meaningful name.
  - It also makes a program less lengthy.
